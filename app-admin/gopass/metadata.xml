    <longdescription lang="en">
        gopass is a rewrite of the pass password manager
        in Go with the aim of making it cross-platform and
        adding additional features. The target audience are
        professional developers and sysadmins (and especially
        teams of those) who are well versed with a command
        line interface. One explicit goal for this project is
        to make it more approachable to non-technical users.
